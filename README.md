# planned.
Period tracker for planning pain, not parenthood (it could probably plan that too though.)


## Motivation
In short, my girlfriend basically dies slowly every two weeks, she has endometriosis and a spastic pelvic floor. Her pain is cyclical, but her cycles are anything but, and keeping track of this stuff is often a group effort because of how busy we are.

Most period tracking apps are geared for fertility and assume your cycle is normal, so we're making our own period tracker app, designed specifically for pain, and using qualitative data such as color and flow to identify patterns over time rather than a generic calendar.

As a software engineer and a simp, I know what I must do next.
